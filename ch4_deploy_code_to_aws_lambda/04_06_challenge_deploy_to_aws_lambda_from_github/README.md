# 04_06 Challenge Deploy to AWS Lambda from GitHub

In this challenge, you’ll verify the integration between your GitHub repository and Jenkins by making a visible code change, committing it to the repo, and confirming that Jenkins automatically deploys the update to your application.

This process demonstrates how Continuous Deployment works in a real-world CI/CD workflow.

## Overview

Make sure the following tabs are open in your browser:

- **TAB 1**: GitHub repository with the application code
- **TAB 2**: Jenkins job page for `python-api`
- **TAB 3**: Live application running the Python API

You’ll complete the following steps:

1. **Update and commit a code change**
2. **Review the Jenkins job triggered by the commit**
3. **Confirm the change in the live application**

Complete all previous challenges before attempting this challenge.

This challenge should take 10 to 15 minutes to complete.
