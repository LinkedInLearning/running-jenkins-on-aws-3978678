# 03_06 Create and test webhooks with other services

The **GitHub plugin** is one of the default plugins used with Jenkins and enables webhook integration between Jenkins and GitHub.

While this course focuses on GitHub, Jenkins is not limited to a single source control provider.

With the help of additional plugins, Jenkins can integrate with services like:

- **GitLab**
- **Bitbucket**
- And many others

The upcoming exercise files demonstrate how to install and configure plugins to receive webhooks from GitLab and Bitbucket—using a similar approach as with GitHub.
