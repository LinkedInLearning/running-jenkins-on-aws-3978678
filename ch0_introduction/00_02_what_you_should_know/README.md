# 00_02 What you should know

Before getting started on this course, there are some things you should be familiar with.  You’ll also need to have two accounts in place.

## Linux Operating Systems

You'll be working with Linux operating systems, specifically **Ubuntu** and **Amazon Linux**. You'll be editing files and installing software using a command-line interface.

You’ll need to be familiar with getting around in the Linux file system and managing Linux services.

## Jenkins Automation Servers

You'll be setting up a **Jenkins controller server** and a **Jenkins build server**. The more comfortable you are with Jenkins, the more straightforward the configurations will be.

## Accounts

You’ll need the following accounts:

- **Amazon Web Services** account where you can create and manage the resources that you'll need for the course.  If you don’t have an account you can sign up for one for free at [aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

- **Github** account where you can store code and configure the starting point for a CI/CD pipeline.  If you don’t have a Github account you can sign up for one for free at [github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

If you need to ramp up or refresh yourself on any of these subjects, there are other courses here in the Linked In Learning library that you can use to get up to speed.
