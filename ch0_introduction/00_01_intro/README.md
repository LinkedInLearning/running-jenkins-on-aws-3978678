# 00_01 Intro

**Jenkins** is a powerful automation framework for managing software builds, deployments, and more.

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is the leading cloud platform, well-suited for hosting build servers and web apps.

This course demonstrates how to integrate Jenkins and AWS to build a **CI/CD pipeline**.

Learners will:

- Set up a web application
- Commit code to a GitHub repository
- Configure Jenkins to build, test, and deploy a web application using AWS resources.
